# rasa-bot-template
Rasa bot template repository.

# Build steps

## Environment Variables

Set the Telegram bot token and Telegram bot username in .env file.

## Launch with Docker

#### Install Docker
Install docker and docker-compose (see instructions on https://www.docker.com/)

### Quick Launch (no debugging)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Launch and Attach (supports debugging)

You will need VS Code with Remote - Containers extension installed. (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

1.  #### Launch this repo as a Remote - Container in VS Code
    In VSCode open this repo and execute command 'Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container' through the Command Palette. VS Code may also recognize the devcontainer folder and prompt you to open it as a container. Either way works.

1.  #### Launch Rasa core/nlu server
    In VSCode 'Run and Debug' tab, select 'rasa run' and click Start Debugging.

    Note:
    - The actions server does not launch automatically with the core/nlu server. You need to manually start the action server as well. Your bot will still work but actions will not execute.
    - To debug incoming messages from Telegram to Rasa, you can set a breakpoint in ".venv/lib/python*/site-packages/rasa/core/channels/telegram.py" under the server route "/webhook".

1.  #### Launch Rasa actions server
    In VSCode 'Run and Debug' tab, select 'rasa run actions' and click Start Debugging.

    Note:
    - To debug action code, just set a breakpoint in the corresponding action file inside "dataset/actions".
